# spanish-learner
A command line or gui program that helps learn spanish words for those who already know english.

spanish-learner.py is a command line program that loads up three dictionary files (the dictionary .py files) and allows you to quickly test what you know from your super h4x0|2 terminal.

spanish-gui.py is a very simply user interface that performs the same functionality as the command line application.

To add your own words, simple edit the dictionary python files to include your new entries.

If you want to add extra dictionaries, you'll need to edit the source code of spanish-learner.py and/or spanish-gui.py to accomodate.
